# About me

I am a senior in physics at the University of Idaho looking forward to graduate school to further study photonics and applications of optical systems. Currently, I contribute research in two separate labs; studying visualization methods of Numerical Relativistic simulation data with [Dr. Zach Etienne](https://etienneresearch.com/), and researching Optical Thermodynamics and TIRF Microscopy with [Dr. Andreas Vasdekis](https://www.uidaho.edu/sci/physics/people/faculty/andreasv). 

Since joining Dr. Etienne's group in my freshman year, I have developed, with the help of my undergraduate colleagues, a novel workflow for visualizing gravitational waves produced by binary black hole collisions. As a Research Assistant during the summer of 2023, I focused on building a framework for visualizing [GRMHD](https://einsteintoolkit.org/thornguide/GRHayLET/IllinoisGRMHD/documentation.html) simulation data, some samples of which are provided to the right. Throughout this time I gained proficiency in GitHub, Jupyter Notebook documentation, and Unix, as well as experience with Python. 

Having joined Dr. Vasdekis' team at the beginning of my senior year, I am in the midst of researching both Optical Thermodynamics and TIRF Microscopy. Outside of the optics lab, my study of Optical Thermodynamics has served as a side project to consider the application of Optical Thermodynamics to imaging systems, extended from the original work in multimode fiber optic systems. Instructed by Dr. Vasdekis and Dr. Ram Kasu, my undergraduate colleague and I are working to examine the potential use of non-guassian beams in TIRF Microscopy. 

Outside of university research, I keep myself busy with various projects ranging from designing and 3D printing my own optomechanical systems, to building random radio and GPS devices. More details on specific projects like these can be found in the [Projects](link to projects.html webpage) as well as more information about me personally in the [More about me](link to more.html webpage) page.
