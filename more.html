            <h2>More about me</h2>

            <p>
                Aside from academic pursuits, I get up to all sorts of random things. On this page, I'll briefly mention some of my interests to give you a better picture of who I am.
            </p>

            <h2>Among many things, I enjoy...</h2>

            <h3>Public Lands</h3>
            <p>
                With over 60% of Idaho being public land, I spend a fair bit of time exploring the nearby forests and mountains. Being an Idaho native, I'm quite grateful to live in such a scenic state.
            </p>

            <h3>Binders and Manila Envelopes</h3>
            <p>
                In high school I stumbled upon an unlimited print quota in the library which started a tradition of compiling research articles into binders. What began with a few printed papers has grown into 18 binders and a few manila envelopes covering topics from neuropharmacology to optical vortex knots.
            </p>

            <h3>Maps</h3>
            <p>
                After discovering a glitch that let me order maps for free, I ended up with a 40-pound box of USGS maps on my doorstep. Since then, I've worked at the University of Idaho Map Room for a time and have collected nearly 500 maps that I regularly use for various trips.
            </p>

            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>
                Growing up surrounded by music, I've developed a passion for composing and improvising. I mostly stick to jazz and pseudo-classical piano, but I occasionally dabble in synthesizers for more experimental sounds.
            </p>

            <h3>Postcards</h3>
            <p>
                In middle school, a friend and I discovered a family's postcard collection in an antique shop, which led me to start my own. I‚Äôve since exchanged hundreds of postcards with friends and strangers around the world. If you're interested, check out <a href="https://postcrossing.com" target="_blank">Postcrossing</a>!
            </p>

            <h3>Cassettes and iPods</h3>
            <p>
                As an advocate for tangible media, I'm a huge fan of mixtapes and iPods. There‚Äôs something gratifying about putting effort into acquiring music, whether it's creating a cassette or organizing MP3s. And, thanks to the <a href="https://www.iflash.xyz/" target="_blank">iFlash</a> project, old iPods can now store up to two terabytes of music!
