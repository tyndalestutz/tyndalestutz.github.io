            <h2>More about me</h2>

            <p>
                Aside from academic pursuits, I get up to all sorts of random things. On this page, I'll briefly mention some of my interests to give you a more complete picture of who I am.
            </p>

            <h2>Among many things, I enjoy...</h2>

            <!-- Section: Public Lands -->
            <h3>Public Lands</h3>
            <p>
                Idaho is comprised of just over 60% public lands, making it effortless to find a nearby spot to camp or hike. As an Idaho native, I'm proud to say that I'm quite familiar with Idaho's forests and mountains, and I'm thankful to live in such a scenic state.
            </p>

            <!-- Section: Binders -->
            <h3>Binders and Manila Envelopes</h3>
            <p>
                During my junior year of high school, I somehow ended up with an unlimited print quota in the library. This inspired a tradition of creating a new binder two or three times a year, dedicated to research articles I've found on various scientific topics, ranging from neuropharmacology in the dreaming brain to studies of optical vortex knots. Today, I have a shelf with 18 binders and a handful of manila envelopes for papers I'm currently reading.
            </p>

            <!-- Section: Maps -->
            <h3>Maps</h3>
            <p>
                After realizing I had a small collection of maps growing from various backpacking trips and excursions, a friend and I decided to see how much a few specific topo maps would cost on the USGS website. We ran into a bizarre website glitch that allowed certain maps to be checked out for $0 plus shipping. We ended up with a 40-pound box of maps on our doorstep, having each paid only $9.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then, I have worked in the University of Idaho Map Room for a time and amassed nearly 500 maps that I regularly use on random afternoon or weekend trips.
            </p>

            <!-- Section: Musical Composition -->
            <h3>Musical Composition</h3>
            <p>
                As the son of two musical virtuosos, I've been spoiled with access to innumerable instruments and a wealth of musical inspiration. Despite several failed attempts at taking piano lessons, I never really learned how to sight-read sheet music. However, I've been improvising and composing since then. I mainly stick to jazz and pseudo-classical piano, but every once in a while, I'll create a spacey-synth track.
            </p>

            <!-- Section: Postcards -->
            <h3>Postcards</h3>
            <p>
                While in middle school, my friend and I came across a box at an antique shop containing a life-long collection of postcards exchanged between members of one large family. After spending a year piecing together the life story of each correspondent, we decided it was time to begin our own collection of postcards.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ever since, I've exchanged several hundred postcards with friends and strangers around the world. If you haven't heard of it, you should check out <a href="https://postcrossing.com" target="_blank">Postcrossing</a>!
            </p>

            <!-- Section: Cassettes and iPods -->
            <h3>Cassettes and iPods</h3>
            <p>
                Lastly, as a proponent of tangible media, I'm a huge fan of mixtapes and iPods. While the ability to stream virtually any music is incredible in its own right, I think there's an intrinsically personal quality to listening to music that one has put effort into acquiring‚Äîwhether that be through setting up a cassette recording, or downloading and organizing MP3s. And, thanks to the <a href="https://www.iflash.xyz/" target="_blank">iFlash</a> project, you can store up to a couple of terabytes of music on an old iPod!
