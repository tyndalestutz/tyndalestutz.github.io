                I am a senior in physics at the University of Idaho, aiming to pursue graduate studies focused on photonics and the applications of optical systems. Currently, I am contributing to research in two separate labs: studying visualization methods of numerical relativity simulation data with 
                <a href="https://etienneresearch.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Zach Etienne</a>, 
                and conducting research on Optical Thermodynamics and TIRF Microscopy with 
                <a href="https://www.uidaho.edu/sci/physics/people/faculty/andreasv" target="_blank">Dr. Andreas Vasdekis</a>.

                Since joining Dr. Etienne's group in my freshman year, I have worked with undergraduate colleagues to develop a novel workflow for visualizing gravitational waves produced by binary black hole collisions. As a Research Assistant during the summer of 2023, I focused on building a framework for visualizing

                Having joined Dr. Vasdekis' team at the start of my senior year, I am currently researching Optical Thermodynamics and TIRF Microscopy. In addition, I have been exploring Optical Thermodynamics as a side project to examine its application to imaging systems, extending the original work in multimode fiber optic systems. Alongside Dr. Vasdekis and Dr. Ram Kasu, I am working with a colleague to investigate the potential use of non-Gaussian beams in TIRF Microscopy.

                Outside of university research, I engage in various personal projects, from designing and 3D printing optomechanical systems to building radio and GPS devices. More details on these projects can be found on the 
                <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page, and further personal information is available on the 
                <a href="more.html">More about me</a> page. Additionally, my resume can be downloaded <a href="assets/resume.pdf">here</a> or on this site on the <a href="resume.html">Resume</a> page.
